# sentiment-analysis
You are asked to label phrases on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive.  Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.  The sentiment labels are:  0 - negative 1 - somewhat negative 2 - neutral 3 - somewhat positive 4 - positive  Each phrase has a PhraseId. Each sentence has a SentenceId.   Phrases that are repeated (such as short/common words) are only included once in the data.
